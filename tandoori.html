            <li>2 tsp Oil for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and clean chicken leg quarters. Pat dry and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add oil which helps to yield a crisp outer texture when pan seared.</li>
            <li>Yogurt acts as a tenderizer and also helps to keep the meat moist and juicy while cooking.</li>
            <li>Add lemon juice, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, Kashmiri chili powder, ginger garlic paste, black pepper powder, tandoori masala, garam masala powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix well to coat the chicken evenly.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for few hours, preferably overnight to soak up more flavor and to keep the meat juicy and moist.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill pan over high heat and place the marinated chicken legs leaving enough room between them.</li>
            <li>Cook and sear for 10 minutes over high flame. Then cover and cook for 20 minutes over medium flame.</li>
            <li>As it cooks it will start to collect steam on the lid, use all the water droplets to deglaze the pan. </li>
            <li>Flip the chicken to cook the other side. Brush some oil on top or use the juice from the chicken to baste. </li>
            <li>Again cover and cook for another 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>At this stage, the chicken will be 95% cooked. Flip again and pan sear for few minutes or until the masala browns.</li>
            <li>Brush with some butter to add more flavor and turn off once all moisture is absorbed. For smoky flavor - place chicken legs on a chapati wire roaster or roti jari and flame over direct flame on stove top or place a small piece of hot charcoal in a cup and place it in the pan along with the chicken. Cover it for few minutes which will flavor the chicken legs with smoky aroma.</li>
            <li>Serve as a starter or as a side for any meal!</li>
