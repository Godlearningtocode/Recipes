        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To us, a buffalo chicken sandwich is totally one of those seasonal foods that we always think about during football season. We love how it's rich and creamy, but also spicy and crispy at the same time. It's literally the perfect game day snack! </p>
        <p> For our go-to version, we craft a sandwich that's made with crispy buffalo fried chicken smothered in ranch dressing and blue cheese, topped with carrots and arugula, and tucked in between a crisp and buttery toasted potato bun.  </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable or peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons Frank's hot sauce, divided</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) unsalted butter </li>
            <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing </li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon blue cheese</li>
            <li>2/3 cup arugula</li>
            <li>2 potato buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Gather the ingredients. </li>
            <li> Begin by brining the chicken. Mix the buttermilk and 1 tablespoon of the Frank's hot sauce in a ziplock bag. Add the chicken and refrigerate up to 2 days.  </li>
            <li> When ready to cook heat peanut or vegetable oil to 360 F. Meanwhile, in a shallow dish, mix flour, salt, and paprika together. </li>
            <li> Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture and let excess liquid fall off. Dip the chicken in the flour mixture, then back in the buttermilk, then back in the flour. </li>
            <li> Add the chicken to the heated oil and fry until cooked through and golden brown, about five minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the heat and set on a paper towel. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt and set aside.  </li>
            <li> To make the buffalo sauce, use a small saucepan. Melt the butter and stir in the reamaining Frank's hot sauce. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, toast the buns by adding a bit of extra butter to a small frying pan and toast the interior of the bun until it's golden and crispy. Set aside. </li>
            <li> Smear both sides of the bun with some ranch dressing. Once the chicken has fried, toss it in the buffalo sauce and place it in the sandwich. Top with arugula and crumbled blue cheese. Serve immediately.  </li>
            
        </ol>
